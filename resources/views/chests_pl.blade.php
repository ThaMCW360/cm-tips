<p data-pw-in-article="true">Coin Master is a part city-builder and part slots machine strategy game with an economy that primarily revolves around chests. You gain levels and unlock new stages by spending coins to build and upgrade Village structures. Chests contain random items that can help speed up the process by allowing you to earn resources more quickly.</p><p data-pw-in-article="true">It’s important to know what chests are and when to buy them if you want to power through stages efficiently. This guide on <strong>Coin Master chests</strong> will cover all the key information about chests—what they are, what they hold, and your odds for receiving cards and spins.</p><h2 id="what-are-coin-master-chests">What are Coin Master chests?</h2><p data-pw-in-article="true">Coin Master chests are treasure boxes earned by playing the game. Each chest has a chance to contain coins, free spins, cards, Pet XP, or Pet Food. There are a lot of types of Coin Master chests; the higher level the chest, the more likely it is to drop a high-level item.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-different-types-of-coin-master-chests">What are the different types of Coin Master chests?</h2><p data-pw-in-article="true">There are literally dozens of different types of chests in Coin Master. Luckily, the developers have a complete breakdown of the types, what they contain, and your odds of getting certain drops. We’ve put together a short list of the main chest types you’ll find in the game. You can find the full list with all the promotional chests on the <a href="https://support.coinmastergame.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030411833-Chest-Probability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Coin Master website</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Chest Type</strong></td><td><strong>Unlocked at Village Level…</strong></td><td><strong>Contains…</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Wooden Chest</td><td>3</td><td>2 Cards</td></tr><tr><td>Golden Chest</td><td>3</td><td>4 Cards</td></tr><tr><td>Magical Chest</td><td>3</td><td>8 Cards</td></tr><tr><td>Small Lucky Chest</td><td>4</td><td>6 Cards (a chance of a Joker card), Pet XP and Spins</td></tr><tr><td>Small Easter Chest</td><td>10</td><td>6 Cards (a chance of a Joker card), Pet XP and Spins</td></tr><tr><td>Big Easter Chest</td><td>20</td><td>8 Cards (a chance of a Joker card), Pet XP and Spins</td></tr><tr><td>Big Lucky Chest</td><td>30</td><td>8 Cards (a chance of a Joker card), Pet XP and Spins</td></tr><tr><td>Valentine’s Chest</td><td>30</td><td>6 Cards (a chance of a Joker card), Pet snacks, Pet XP and Spins</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Chest</td><td>70</td><td>6 Cards, Spins and Pet XP</td></tr><tr><td>Ruby Chest</td><td>110</td><td>8 Cards (a chance of a Joker card), Spins, Pet XP and 1 Pet Snack</td></tr><tr><td>Mystery Chest</td><td>–</td><td>6 Cards (a chance of a Joker card), Pet snacks and Spins</td></tr><tr><td>Emerald Chest</td><td>–</td><td>4 Cards, Spins and Pet XP</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 id="what-s-the-best-chest-in-coin-master">What’s the best chest in Coin Master?</h2></div><p data-pw-in-article="true">You’re probably saying right now, “Cut to the chase and tell me: what chest should I buy?” Unfortunately, there’s no quick answer for that question. Each chest type has its own drop probabilities, so the chest you should buy depends on what you need right now.</p><p data-pw-in-article="true">For example, do you want to complete your low-level card collections? Then stay away from the higher-level chests! The lower-level chests have much higher drop rates for 1- and 2-star cards, so that’s where you should spend your coins.</p><p data-pw-in-article="true">Are you strapped for cash and need an injection of coins to move onto the next stage? Then you should buy a chest that actually has a chance of dropping coins!</p><h2 id="when-should-i-buy-chests">When should I buy chests?</h2><p data-pw-in-article="true">We’ve established that chests are important to making progress in Coin Master. At this point, you may think that buying more chests means it’s easier to complete card collections and move onto higher villages. While that’s generally true, simply hoarding chests isn’t the most cost-effective way of advancing in the game.</p><p data-pw-in-article="true">We’ve found that even in a game like Coin Master, patience is a virtue. This is doubly so in the earlier Villages. Since the low-level collections are made up of very common cards, you can complete them by simply looting other Vikings and finishing your Villages.</p><p data-pw-in-article="true">At some point, you’ll need some pretty rare cards. Some of these are too rare to easily collect just by raiding Villages. This is when you should start considering buying chests.</p><p data-pw-in-article="true">Another good time to buy chests is when you’re one card away from completing a set, especially if it’s super-rare or golden.</p><p data-pw-in-article="true">That concludes our quick guide to Coin Master chests. Now that you know what chests are and when to buy them, you can start really conquering your rivals in Coin Master.</p></div>
