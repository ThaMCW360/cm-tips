                <h3>Wait a moment</h3>

                <h2>Coin hacking tips and tricks</h2>
                <h3>Don't hoard coins!</h3>
                <p>You are still exposed to a potential raid that will consume a large chunk of your coins. For this reason, you should always spend coins whenever you can afford them. This is especially important if you don't have shields or haven't unlocked Rhino Pet yet!</p>
                <p>The large amount of coins in your pocket also makes you a prime target for large heists. A Big Raid is a Raid with a max bet that, if successful, could end up with the Invader taking millions of your coins!</p>
                <h3>Big rallies</h3>
                <p>If you have a lot of Coin Master Free Spins available, it may be tempting to increase your bet amount and take advantage of the Multiply Free Spins Bonus. This is a completely viable way to accelerate your coin earnings. However, it's better to save your turns to loot very rich players.</p>
                <p>Above the slot you can see the Coin Master assigned to you and your current Coin Shops. Keep your bets on Coin Masters with lots of coins. Since the number of coins you win in a rally is proportional to the number of coins a player has, you have the chance to win a lot of money in a very short time using only max bets on rich coin masters.< /p>
                <p>If you're into big raids, you should always have Foxy as an active pet. Foxy gives you another shovel to dig in raids, giving you a better chance of getting tons of coins.</p>
                <h3>Buy chests in each city</h3>
                <p>Single cards don't provide bonuses, but completing a collection of cards does. When entering a new village, always buy as many chests as you can afford. Lower tier cards are harder to come by as you progress through the village levels, so the early stages are the best places to get the lower tier cards needed to complete your set. There's nothing worse than having to spend a wild to replace a missing standard card you might have received at the start of the game!</p>
                <h3>Don't waste your pet's bonuses</h3>
                <p>Your pet's buff effect is only available for four hours after its activation. If you can't play for four hours, you'll need to save your pet's activation until you have room for four hours to commit to Coin Master.</p>
                <p>Even the defensive rhino; If your base is under siege, it won't defend itself against attacks unless you specifically send it there.</p>
