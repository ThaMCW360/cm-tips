                    <h2>What’s the best chest in Coin Master?</h2>
            </div>
<p> You're probably saying, "Get straight to the point and tell me which chest I should buy." Unfortunately, there is no quick answer.
                to this question. Each type of chest has its own drop chance, so which chest you should buy depends on what you need at the moment. </p>
            <p>For example, do you want to replenish your low-level card collections? So stay away from the taller chests! Lower chests have a much higher drop rate for 1 and 2 star cards, so that's where you should spend your coins.</p>
            <p>Are you low on money and need a coin to get to the next level? Then you should buy yourself a chest that actually has a chance to get coins!</p>
            <h2>When should I buy chests? </h2>
            <p>We discovered that chests are important for progressing in Coin Master. At this point, you might think that if you buy more chests, it will be easier to complete your card collections and move to higher villages. While this is often true, simply collecting chests is not the cheapest way to progress in the game.</p>
            <p>We found that even in a game like Coin Master, patience is a virtue. This is double in the previous towns. Since low-level sets consist of very common cards, you can simply complete them by looting other vikings and resupplying your villages.</p>
            <p> At some point you will need some pretty rare cards. Some of them are too rare to be collected by looting villages. After that you should start buying chests. </p>
            <p>Another good time to buy chests is when you're short on a card to complete your set, especially if it's very rare or gold.</p>
            <p>This concludes our short guide to Coin Master Chests. Now that you know what chests are and when to buy them, you can really beat your rivals in Coin Master.</p>
